# CPPESSENTIALSDXTK
C++ Essentials with DirectX Podcast Repo

In cooperation with the GameDev.tv Community Podcast, some intermediate level programming content for students interested in DirectX programming on Windows.

We are building four simple 2D games using the DirectX Toolkit and Visual Studio 2019 on Windows 10.

We are using DirectX 11 for the simpler interface and rendering pipelines, and our primary focus is on designing an application and building classes.

We assume you can write code and configure Visual Studio, we do not provide any guidance on these topics, we dive right into building games!
